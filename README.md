# CS 271 Computer Architecture & Assembly Language
This repository is an archive of all the programming assignments for CS 271 at Oregon State University taken summer quarter 2021, taught by Justin Goins.

## Course Description
In this course we were introduced to the functional organization and operation of digital computers. Coverage of assembly language; addressing, stacks, argument passing, arithmetic operations, decisions, macros, modularization, linkers and debuggers. By the end of the course, we are able to:

- Access and Interpret binary data stored in memory
- Illustrate the Instruction Execution Cycle
- Create and Analyze well-modularized assembly language programs utilizing decision, repetition, and procedure structures
- Utilize a debugger to Identify and Correct bugs in assembly language programs
- Illustrate the System Stack as it is used for procedure calls and parameter passing
- Illustrate the primary components of a modern Computer Architecture, and Explain their function.
